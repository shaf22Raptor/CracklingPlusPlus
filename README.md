Rapid Whole-Genome Identification of High Quality CRISPR Guide RNAs with the Crackling Method


## Preamble

> The design of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs is not trivial. In particular, it is crucial to evaluate 
the risk of unintended, off-target modifications, but this is computationally expensive. To 
avoid a brute-force approach where each guide RNA is compared against every possible CRISPR 
target site in the genome, we previously introduced Crackling, a guide RNA design tool that 
relies on exact matches over 4bp subsequences to approximate a neighbourhood and accelerate 
off-target scoring by greatly reducing the search space. While this was faster than other 
existing tools, it still generates large neighbourhoods. Here, we aim to further reduce the 
search space by requiring more, now non-contiguous, exact matches. The new implementation, 
called Crackling++, is benchmarked against our initial approach and other off-target evaluation 
tools. We show that it provides the fastest way to assess candidate guide RNAs. By using memorymapped 
files, it also scales to the largest genomes. 
Crackling++ is available at https://github.com/bmds-lab/CracklingPlusPlus under the Berkeley Software 
Distribution (BSD) 3-Clause license.

## Dependencies
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
- [RNAfold](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAfold.1.html)

Note: Please ensure that your version of Boost that you have installed is supported by your version of CMake.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmds-lab/CracklingPlusPlus.git ~/CracklingPlusPlus
cd ~/CracklingPlusPlus
```

2. Create build directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Run CMake to generate build files

```bash
CMake ..
```

4. Run build system command. E.g. `make`
```bash
make
```
All of the programs (CracklingPlusPlus, ISSLCreateIndex and ExtractOfftargets) have now been built.

## Building Bowtie2 Index
The Bowtie2 manual can be found [here](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml).

Our recommended usage:
```bash
bowtie2-build --threads 128 input-file output-file
```

For example:
```bash
bowtie2-build --threads 128 ~/genomes/mouse.fa ~/genomes/mouse.fa.bowtie2
```

Note: Bowtie2 produces multiple files for its index. When setting the Bowtie2 index variable in the `config.ini` file please use the value you used for `output-file`. So for the example above, you would set `bowtie2-index = ~/genomes/mouse.fa.bowtie2`
## Extract off-targets for ISSL Index
Note: You will need to ensure you have completed the installation step before completing this step as the installation will also install the program needed to extract off-targets. 

The ExtractOfftargets binary can be found in build folder. Based on the install instructions that will be:
```
~/CracklingPlusPlus/build/ExtractOfftargets/ExtractOfftargets
```

Usage:
```bash
ExtractOfftargets <output-file>  {<input-file-1> <input-file-2> ... <input-file-n> | <input-dir>}
```

Arguements:
```
output-file: A filepath to save the off-target sites

input-file-x: A single, or a space serpated list, of multi-FASTA formatted files

input-dir: A directory, containing multiple multi-FASTA formatted files. (Note: This will process EVERY file in the directory)
```

For example:
```bash
ExtractOfftargets ~/genomes/mouse_offtargets.txt ~/genomes/mouse.fa
```
or
```bash
ExtractOfftargets ~/genomes/mouse_offtargets.txt ~/genomes/mouse_chromosone_1.fa ~/genomes/mouse_chromosone_2.fa ~/genomes/mouse_chromosone_3.fa
```
or
```bash
ExtractOfftargets ~/genomes/mouse_offtargets.txt ~/genomes/mouse_fasta_files/
```

## Building ISSL Index

Note: You will need to ensure you have completed the installation step before completing this step as the installation will also install the program needed to build the ISSL Index. 

The ISSLCreateIndex binary can be found in build folder. Based on the install instructions that will be:
```
~/CracklingPlusPlus/build/ISSLCreateIndex/ISSLCreateIndex
```

Usage:
```bash
ISSLCreateIndex <offtarget-sites> <slice-config> <sequence-length> <output-file>
```
Arguements:
```
offtarget-sites: A text file containing off-target sites

slice-config: A text file containing a set of slice configurations (See samples folder in repository)

sequence-length: The length of an off-target site

output-file: A filepath to save the ISSL index
```

For example:
```bash
ISSLCreateIndex ~/genomes/mouse_offtargets.txt ~/CracklingPlusPlus/sample/slice4-5.txt 20 ~/genomes/mouse_indexed.issl
```
## Running CracklingPlusPlus
Please ensure all of the above steps have been completed before running the program. 
To run the program simply fill out the provided `config.ini` in the samples folder and call the program as follows:

```bash
CracklingPlusPlus <config-file>
```
